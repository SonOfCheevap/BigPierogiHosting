The source code to my website, bigpierogi.net

# What is bigpierogi.net?

Its a hobby website I created from scratch I run off my raspberry pi 3. On the website, I show off some servers I run, the status of my servers (when the program doesn't break), and current news on the website and its status

# Features

- Interactable buttons in the top right that can close and minimize the window, and increase font size
- Backgrounds that can be changed by clicking on the "clocK" in the bottom right
- Different "operating systems" by clicking on the start button multiple times
- Live status page of my servers
